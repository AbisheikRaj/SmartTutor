and also used for Entrance Exam students like JEE, NEET. This application have lots of videos about concepts like Maths and Science for classes 6 - 12, NEET syllabus, JEE syllabus
and even rhymes videos for pre-kindergarten kids. The main focus of this application is to learn all things in one place. If I have separate organization like BYJU's or anyother
